## Problem
Our project aims to address the critical problem of rapidly diminishing forests due to urbanization and various factors. This loss triggers economic, social, and environmental challenges, disrupting livelihoods, and exacerbating climate change.

## Solution
We propose an environmental monitoring system that serves a threefold purpose:
- In the short term, it offers real-time insights to local communities dependent on forests, safeguarding their livelihoods.
- In the medium term, it aids environmental agencies and policymakers in making informed decisions to enhance forest conservation efforts.
- In the long term, it contributes globally to climate change mitigation by reducing deforestation rates, ensuring a sustainable environment, and promoting a healthier planet.

## How It Works
Our project is divided into three main parts:
- Data Engineering: We gather and preprocess data from NASA's Copernicus dataset, specifically Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data.
- AI-Machine Learning: We fine-tune the Pritvi Foundation model to monitor environmental changes in forests.
- Deployment: We've developed a user-friendly interface that empowers users to input coordinates and a time range for monitoring.
